Here is a selection of projects I've worked on over the years. It is by all means far from complete.

* [python-amazon-product-api](https://bitbucket.org/basti/python-amazon-product-api) -- A Python wrapper for the [Amazon Product Advertising API](https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/gp/advertising/api/detail/main.html). This module offers a light-weight access to the latest version of the API without getting in your way.
Uses requests and py.test for extensive (!) testing.
* [pytest-localserver](https://bitbucket.org/pytest-dev/pytest-localserver) -- py.test plugin to test server connections locally. Supports HTTP, HTTPS and SMTP.
* [python-jambel](https://github.com/jambit/python-jambel) -- Python interface to [jambit](http://jambit.com)'s fast feedback light.
* [weewar-monitor](https://github.com/redtoad/weewar-monitor) -- This is a small GTK application that lives in your system tray and periodically checks state of your ongoing Weewar games. If a game requires attention, a notification is displayed via libnotify.
