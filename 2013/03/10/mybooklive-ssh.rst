**Update:** I now own a `WD My Cloud <http://www.amazon.de/dp/B00FOKN7FG/>`_ which also has a USB port to backup data directly to external drives. 
Together with a `HDD dock <http://www.amazon.de/dp/B0099PUVWO/>`_ this make a sweet backup solution.

I've got myself a `Western Digital My Book Live <http://www.amazon.de/dp/B00499DMRQ/>`_ for all my baby pictures. Nice thing about it, it runs debian wheezy AND you can access it via SSH!

To enable the access, point your favourite browser to http://mybooklive.local/UI/ssh and click the checkbox.
