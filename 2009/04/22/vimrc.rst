Custom ``.vimrc``
=================

.. tags:: vim

For the first time in ages I have used vim again. And, of course, the first 
thing I did was to customise the default behaviour.

So far there are 3 things that I need regularly:

* Toggle line numbers with <F2>
* Toggle paste mode (to avoid unintended indenting) with <F9>
* Execute python script in buffer with <F5>

All of this can be done with "my" .vimrc.

.. literalinclude:: .vimrc
   :language: vim
