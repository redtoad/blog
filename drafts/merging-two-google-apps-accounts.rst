Merging two Google Apps accounts
================================

Here is the problem: I started out using Google Apps on one of my domains,
simply to try it out. Now I want to use on my *real* domain but preferably in
one account. However, it doesn't seem to be possible to change the primary
domain after you created your account.

What am I to do?

Sadly, there seems only one solution: delete your first account account and add
it as an alternative domain to your second. Somund easy. But you have to wait
for 5 days! 

"Hang on! But if I want to keep receiving e-mails in those 5 days?"
